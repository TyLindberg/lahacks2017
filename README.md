Text Mirror is a data analytics web application that uses an individual's text messages (with permission) to make measurements and predictions related to their messaging habits.

Using Microsoft Azure's Machine Learning Studio, Text Mirror can make predictions about whom you plan message, plot the sentiment of conversations over time, and display common words to each friend.
